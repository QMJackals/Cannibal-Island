# Cannibal Island
## Credits
This game was designed and developed by Mohammed Abubakar, Yesh Chandiramani, Supachai Mangkud, and Paul-Sebastian Niga

## Story
You find yourself stranded on a deserted island, equipped with only a simple knife and a makeshift bow. After aimlessly wandering around for a few days, you establish a campsite and set up an SOS signal - in the hope that passing ships may rescue you. The island seems relatively peaceful during the day, but come nightfall, the babaric inhabitants roam the land and have only one thing on their mind - fresh meat. Defend yourself against the relentless cannibal horde and survive long enough for the much-anticipated rescue. Don't waste daylight - navigate your surroundings and explore the expanses to uncover the hidden secrets that reveal the terrifying past of **Cannibal Island**. 

*Just be sure not to become part of it...*

## How to Play

### Opening and playing the game
To play the game, click on the up-to-date version **(v1.0)** link from above. This will take you to a GitHub Page that runs the WebGL Build. Allow the game to load (a few seconds) and you will be prompted with the start menu - press **Play** to start.

### Controls
- **WASD** for player movement
- **Spacebar** to jump
- Mouse/Trackpad for rotating the camera field of view

- **Right Click** for ranged combat
- **R** to swap ranged ammo type
- **Esc** to pause game and adjust mouse sensitivity

### Aim of the game
During the day, the player is free to roam around the island, exploring its beauty, collecting **arrows**, and discovering the **10** unique *secrets* that are scattered around the map. These are highlighted and the player must find each of them and utilise their inititive to piece together the story behind **Cannibal Island** and its inhabitants. The story element is **not** compulsory, but exists for the lore-hunters. For the action-seekers, gathering ranged ammo is advisable, for it will aid the inevitable battles you will face during the **night** - many waves of cannibals will spawn and track the player down, attacking with melee damage. Players must be prepared and take note of their **health** (which regenerates slowly over time), and each night provides an escalating challenge - the number of waves and numerosity of enemies **increases**, leading to higher levels of difficulty throughout the game. Survive **5** full days to outlive the dangers of the island, before rescue arrives and the game is won.
