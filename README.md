### Credits
This game was designed and developed by Mohammed Abubakar, Yesh Chandiramani, Supachai Mangkud, and Paul-Sebastian Niga

### Story
You find yourself stranded on a deserted island, equipped with only a simple knife and a makeshift bow. After aimlessly wandering around for a few days, you establish a campsite and set up an SOS signal - in the hope that passing ships may rescue you. The island seems relatively peaceful during the day, but come nightfall, the babaric inhabitants roam the land and have only one thing on their mind - fresh meat. Defend yourself against the relentless cannibal horde and survive long enough for the much-anticipated rescue. Don't waste daylight - navigate your surroundings and explore the expanses to uncover the hidden secrets that reveal the terrifying past of **Cannibal Island**. 

*Just be sure not to become part of it...*
